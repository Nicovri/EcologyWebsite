This is my January 2022 project of building a website using WordPress. The website will be named **Environment as our First Priority**. It is supposed to follow the basic rules for the profesionnal development of a website:

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

1. **Structure**

> First draft of how pages could be organized

&nbsp;

* *For every page:*
  * Pop-up window (every page but only once per visit)
  * Maintenance page
  * RGPD legal page
  * Menu (logo, buttons/dropping list of buttons, change language)
  * Footer (logo, sitemap, social medias)

&nbsp;

* *Homepage*
  * description summarized of every part of the website

&nbsp;

* *Improvements*
  * *Footprint*
    * ways to improve our footprint (gas emissions, plastic, trash in general, food waste, water waste)
  * *"Lifehacks"/Solutions*
    * there is no better way than others to act (every action and every improvement is a step toward a better future)
    * ideas to find new solutions and improvements
  * *Inspirations*
    * websites, famous people/youtubers, names of experts

&nbsp;

* *Act Now*
  * *Spread the word*
    * talk about this topic with your close ones
    * and talk about solutions
    * finally, don't worry about anything, if they act then you did a great job
  * *Participate*
    * types of events you can join to help even more
  * *Gather people*
    * you can even create your own event if you have a bit of motivation to do so

&nbsp;

* *Blog*
  * search an article bar
  * connection to post comments on articles (admin for me, guest for others)
  * grid view for articles

&nbsp;

* *About*
  * Who I am and why this website

&nbsp;

* *Contact*
  * contact form

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
